The proposed image enhancement system involves the conversion of the image file into a 
hex format using MATLAB, application of enhancement algorithms such as contrast 
adjustment, brightness correction, thresholding, and image inversion with the use of 
spatial parallelism for efficient processing, and the generation of an output image with 
enhanced pixel values and standard BMP header values. This methodology aims to 
improve the quality of the image by preparing the data, applying enhancement operations, 
and producing a visually improved output
